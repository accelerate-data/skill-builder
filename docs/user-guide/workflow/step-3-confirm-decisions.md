# Step 3: Confirm Decisions

The agent analyzes all your answers from Steps 1 and 2 and produces a structured set of decisions. Your job is to review them before the skill is generated.

## What's on screen after the agent finishes

**Decisions Complete summary card** (at top)

| Column | What it shows |
|---|---|
| **Decisions** | Total decisions, how many are resolved, how many had conflicts resolved, how many need review |
| **Quality** | Count of reconciled conflicts; "No unresolvable contradictions" or a red "Contradictions — review required" message |

**Contradiction banner** (appears in red if contradictions were found)
*"Contradictory inputs detected — some answers are logically incompatible. Review decisions marked 'needs-review' before generating the skill."*

**Decision cards** (listed below the summary)

Each card shows a decision ID (e.g. D1), a title, and a status badge.

| Badge | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **resolved** | Decision is clear and confirmed |
| **conflict-resolved** | Two conflicting answers were reconciled by the agent |
| **needs-review** | The agent could not resolve a contradiction — you should review this before continuing |

Click any card to expand it and see:
- **Original question**
- **Decision** — what was decided
- **Implication** — what this decision means for the skill

## How to continue to Step 4

1. Review the decision cards. Pay close attention to any marked **needs-review** or flagged in the contradiction banner.
2. Click **Next Step** at the bottom right to advance to Step 4 (Generate Skill).

There are no required fields on this step — you can always continue regardless of decision status.

> If you see **needs-review** decisions and want to change your answers, click a completed step in the sidebar to go back, correct your answers, and re-run from that point. See [How to reset a step](overview.md#how-to-reset-a-step).
